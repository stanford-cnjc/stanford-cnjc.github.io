A flurry of recent technical advances in measuring and quantifying naturalistic behaviors provide an important opportunity for advancing brain science. However, the problem of understanding unrestrained behavior in the context of neural recordings and manipulations remains unsolved, and developing approaches to addressing this challenge is critical. Here we discuss considerations in computational neuroethology\u2014the science of quantifying naturalistic behaviors for understanding the brain\u2014and propose strategies to evaluate progress. We point to open questions that require resolution and call upon the broader systems neuroscience community to further develop and leverage measures of naturalistic, unrestrained behavior, which will enable us to more effectively probe the richness and complexity of the brain.\\"","location":"LKSC 209","time":"6:00PM","files":[{"url":"https://stanford-cnjc-files.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/2019/oct/session_02/Datta_2019.pdf","name":"Computational Neuroethology: A Call to Action (Datta et al., 2019)"}]},{"date":"2019-11-13","series":"","speakers":[{"name":"Gabriel Mel","url":"","domain":"stanford.edu","handle":"meldefon"},{"name":"Ben Sorscher","url":"","domain":"gmail.com","handle":"bsorsch"}],"title":"Grid Cells in Recurrent Neural Networks","description":"Recent studies have found that RNNs trained to solve a navigational task naturally develop periodic spatial tuning similar to that of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) grid cells, raising the exciting possibility that such in silico models could give insight into MEC function or suggest novel recording and manipulation experiments. However, as of now almost nothing is known about the precise circuit mechanisms responsible for grid firing or path integration in these networks, posing a challenge both to neuroscientists and those interested in deep network analysis. Here we study the \\"neurophysiology\\" of these RNNs, and show that despite their apparent complexity and biologically characteristic \\"messiness\\", they can be understood in terms of a small number of intuitive network mechanisms. This analysis shows how grid firing arises within trained RNNs. Time permitting, we will present a mathematical theory that explains why hexagonal grids emerge as the optimal patterns for the navigation task.","location":"LKSC 209","time":"6:00PM","files":[{"name":"Session Slide Deck","url":"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1E4H1MxdJizO1wqrgIozycwUnLvh2tjGcP3xbT9Dei2E/edit?usp=sharing"}]},{"date":"2019-12-11","series":"","speakers":[{"name":"Jay Bhasin","url":""},{"name":"Max Gagnon","url":""}],"title":"The Eighty Five Percent Rule for optimal learning","description":"A common principle in learning new knowledge or acquiring a new skill is to start with something easy, and progressively challenge yourself with the harder stuff.

Hippocampal place cells fire in one or few restricted spatial locations in a given environment. Between environmental contexts, place cell firing fields remap (turning on/off or moving to a new spatial location), providing a unique population-wide neural code for context specificity. However, the manner by which features associated with a given context combine to drive place cell remapping remains a matter of debate. Here we show that remapping of neural representations in region CA1 of the hippocampus is strongly driven by prior beliefs about the frequency of certain contexts, and that remapping is equivalent to an optimal estimate of the identity of the current context under that prior. This prior-driven remapping is learned early in training and remains robust to changes in behavioral task-demands. Furthermore, a network model that uses a simple associative learning mechanism is sufficient to reproduce these results. Our findings demonstrate that place cell remapping is a generalization of representing an animal\u2019s location. Rather than simply representing location in physical space, the hippocampus represents an optimal estimate of location in a multi-dimensional stimulus space.","location":"LKSC 209","time":"6:00PM","files":[{"url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1av6NaY7l99w9swFvQ_eVKe2IfBf6XsOz/view?usp=sharing","name":"Session Slide Deck"},{"url":"https://github.com/GiocomoLab/PlittGiocomo_CA1Morph_2019","name":"Github Repository"}]},{"date":"2020-02-05","series":"","speakers":[{"name":"Dawn Finzi","url":""},{"name":"Josh Ryu","url":""}],"title":"Receptive fields: representations of feature and space in visual cortex","description":"Receptive fields have been integral to the study of visual neuroscience since Hubel and Weisel.

Because replay sequences typically occur when the animal is at rest, replay is hypothesized to be part of an internal cognitive process that enables the retrieval of past spatial memories and the planning of future movement. Traditionally, replay sequences have been discovered by identifying sharp wave ripples (SWRs)\u2014high frequency oscillations that occur in association with replay\u2014and then looking within SWRs for spatially continuous patterns of neural spiking. This does not fully account for the content or timing of replay sequences, however. Replay sequences do not always co-occur with sharp wave ripples, have more complex dynamics than spatially continuous movement, have different temporal ordering than during movement, and may change based on task. <br /><br />In this talk, we will introduce a switching state space framework to describe the richness of replay sequences. We show how defining discrete latent states associated with continuous latent movement dynamics and point process observations allows us to identify when non-local replay sequences occur, categorize the type of sequence based on latent movement dynamics, and decode the spatial trajectory. We will then show how this can be applied to a complex operant conditioning task.","location":"LKSC 209","time":"6:00PM","files":[]},{"date":"2020-08-05","series":"","speakers":[{"name":"Daniel Bear","url":"https://neuroscience.stanford.edu/people/daniel-bear","handle":"dbear","domain":"stanford.edu"}],"title":"Learning Physical Graph Representations from Visual Scenes","description":"Human vision is object-centric: we partition scenes into discrete objects and attribute physical properties to them, including appearance, position, shape, material composition, and their relations to each other. This abstraction is important for higher cognition, as most of our behaviors and goals are specified in terms of entities and relations &mdash; not pixel-level detail. Despite this, most state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms are based on image-like internal representations; if \\"objects\\" are present at all, they are typically given only \\"semantic\\" properties, not the physical ones needed for useful interaction. To begin addressing this gap, we\'ve developed a way to augment computer vision algorithms with object-centric representations. We call these representations \\"Physical Scene Graphs\\" (PSGs) because they have both a hierarchical graphical structure and an explicit encoding of physical properties of a scene\'s visual elements, such as their position, shape, texture, and so on. Algorithms that infer PSG representations from visual input &mdash; \\"PSGNets\\" &mdash; groups visual features into discrete, unsupervised entities (\\"objects\\") and predict their physical attributes as explicit components of associated vectors. The algorithm is recursive, hierarchically constructing a graph of high-level objects from their low-level parts. I\'ll talk about the architecture of PSGNets, our results using them to segment visual scenes into objects without supervision, and &mdash; if there\'s time &mdash; how we\'re hoping to connect them back to neural circuits in biological visual systems.","location":"Zoom (Link and Password in Email)","time":"6:00PM","files":[{"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12373","name":"arXiv Preprint"},{"url":"https://stanford.zoom.us/rec/share/3NV2N7bp9m5IeLf29kbUHfMALL66eaa82ndPrPIIxRkymsCpVmpdKADGagpSQBHT","name":"Stream the Recorded Zoom Session"}]},{"date":"TBD","series":"","speakers":[{"name":"Scottie Alexander","url":""}],"title":"(Postponed) Special Guest Session: Topic to be Announced","location":"LKSC 209","time":"6:00PM","files":[]},{"date":"2020-08-13","series":"CNJCx","speakers":[{"name":"Tucker Fisher","handle":"tgfisher","domain":"stanford.edu","url":"https://tgfisher.github.io/#/"},{"name":"Eshed Margalit","handle":"eshedm","domain":"stanford.edu","url":"http://www.eshedmargalit.com"},{"name":"Josh Melander","handle":"melander","domain":"stanford.edu","url":""}],"title":"CNJCx: Practical Python Week 1","description":"Having a comfortable, modern, and efficient development setup is the first step toward learning the tools and skills needed in the rest of the series.
